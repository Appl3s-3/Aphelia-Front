                An item is a unit in the inventory students may borrow. The Items page will list all the items.

                The Items page will list all the items that are in the faculty's inventory. You may be given permission to borrow certain types of items, or request to borrow an item. To borrow an item, click the hamburger button (3 horizontal lines) beside the items and select 'Borrow', or 'Request to Borrow'. If you have requested an item you will have to await the confirmation of an authorised individual before it is marked as borrowed.
                <i>The head of the faculty will decide the types of items you are able to borrow or request.</i>
